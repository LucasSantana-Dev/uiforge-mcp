# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **sqlite-vss vector index**: HNSW-based approximate nearest-neighbor search for embeddings
  - O(log n) search replacing O(n) brute-force — 7x faster at 100 embeddings, 100x+ at 25K
  - Graceful degradation: falls back to brute-force on unsupported platforms
  - New module `src/lib/ml/vector-index.ts` with init, index, search, rebuild functions
  - Rebuild script: `npx tsx src/scripts/rebuild-vector-index.ts`
  - Zero schema migration — VSS virtual table is separate from existing tables

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **RAG-Powered Specialist Agents**: Semantic search over external datasets for context-aware generation
  - Component Architect: shadcn/ui component library (50+ production components)
  - Accessibility Auditor: axe-core rules (50+ WCAG rules) + WAI-ARIA patterns (30 widget patterns)
  - Style Recommender: Material Design 3 + GitHub Primer design tokens (500+ entries)
  - Quality Scorer: RAG-based a11y compliance checking with violation detection
  - Prompt Enhancer: ARIA pattern and a11y rule injection for context-aware prompts
- **Data Ingestion CLI** (`src/scripts/ingest-training-data.ts`): Download and embed external datasets
  - Sources: shadcn/ui, axe-core, Material Design 3 tokens, Primer tokens, WAI-ARIA APG patterns
  - Built-in fallback datasets when external repos unavailable
  - Stats and test-query modes for verification
- **Style Recommender Module** (`src/lib/ml/style-recommender.ts`): Design token recommendation engine
  - RAG retrieval from ingested token embeddings
  - 10 industry presets (fintech, saas, healthcare, etc.)
  - 12 mood modifiers (bold, calm, playful, etc.)
  - Integrated into generation pipeline
- **Cross-Repo Knowledge Sync** (`src/scripts/sync-knowledge.ts`): Export embeddings as JSONL for mcp-gateway
  - Incremental sync with timestamp tracking
  - Agent-specific routing metadata
- **Synthetic Training Data Generator** (`src/scripts/generate-training-data.ts`): LoRA fine-tuning preparation
  - Quality-scorer: degraded code pairs (good/medium/bad)
  - Prompt-enhancer: simplified → enhanced prompt pairs
  - Style-recommender: industry/mood → design token mappings
- Extended `IEmbedding.sourceType` union with `rule`, `token`, `pattern`, `example`
- `enhancePromptWithRAG()`: async RAG-enhanced prompt enhancement
- `scoreQualityWithRAG()`: async RAG-enhanced quality scoring
- Lower synthetic data thresholds for `hasEnoughData()`

### Changed
- `generate_ui_component` tool now performs semantic search before generation
- `audit_accessibility` tool enriches issues with axe-core rule IDs and WCAG criteria
- Quality scoring upgraded from heuristic-only to RAG + heuristic hybrid

### Technical Details
- All RAG features degrade gracefully — zero behavior change when embeddings table is empty
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces
- CPU-first, zero-cost design: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings (~50ms each)
- Expected ~680 embeddings from Phase 1 sources, ~25K from Phase 5 HuggingFace datasets

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **ESLint**: Resolved all ESLint warnings and errors (32 issues fixed)
  - Removed unused imports (`ConfigNotInitializedError`, `ModelId`, `designContextStore`)
  - Replaced logical OR (`||`) with nullish coalescing (`??`) operators
  - Fixed non-null assertions with safer nullish coalescing
  - Prefixed unused variables and parameters with underscore
  - Replaced string concatenation with template literals
  - Added proper ESLint disable comments for external library `any` types
  - Removed deprecated `.eslintignore` file (migrated to config `ignores`)
- **Code Quality**: Achieved zero ESLint warnings and errors
- **Files Modified**: 15+ files across `src/lib/`, `src/tools/`, and `src/scripts/`

### Technical Details
- **Embeddings**: Properly handled `@huggingface/transformers` dynamic imports with ESLint disable comments
- **Database**: Fixed unused variable references in `design-references/database/store.ts`
- **ML Components**: Updated all ML-related files to use nullish coalescing
- **Tools**: Fixed unused parameters in `generate-ui-component.ts` and other tool files
