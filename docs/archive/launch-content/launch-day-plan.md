Great question! The architecture uses the Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK with a zero-cost approach. All processing happens locally - no cloud services or API keys needed. You can see the full source code at github.com/lucassantana/uiforge-mcp
```

#### **For Feature Requests**

```
Thanks for the suggestion! That's a great idea for v0.5.0. I've added it to the roadmap. Feel free to open an issue on GitHub to track it, or even better - contributions are welcome! 🚀
```

#### **For Bug Reports**

```
Sorry to hear you're running into issues! Could you open a GitHub issue with details about your environment? I'll investigate and get a fix out quickly. In the meantime, try the Docker version which has fewer dependency issues.
