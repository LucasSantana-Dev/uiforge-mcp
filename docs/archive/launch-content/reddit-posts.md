**Title:** Built an open-source MCP server that generates entire UI applications
from text

**Post:** Hey r/MachineLearning!

I just launched UIForge MCP - a Model Context Protocol server that transforms
natural language into production-ready UI applications.

## What It Does

- **Full Application Scaffolding**: Generate complete React/Next.js/Vue/Angular
  apps
- **Screenshot-to-Code**: Convert images into working components
- **Interactive Prototypes**: Create clickable HTML prototypes with navigation
- **Design Mockups**: Generate SVG/PNG UI designs
- **Accessibility Auditing**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with fix suggestions
- **Figma Integration**: Bidirectional design token flow

## Tech Stack

- Built on Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK
- 16 production-ready tools
- Zero-cost architecture (100% FOSS)
- TypeScript + Node.js
- No cloud dependencies

## Try It Out

```bash
npx -y uiforge-mcp@latest
```

## Why ML/Dev Community Might Care

- Demonstrates practical MCP server implementation
- Shows AI-to-code generation beyond simple snippets
- Zero vendor lock-in approach
- Production-ready tooling for AI workflows

GitHub: https://github.com/lucassantana/uiforge-mcp npm: uiforge-mcp

Would love feedback from the AI/ML community on the architecture and potential
improvements!
